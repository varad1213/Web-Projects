        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>The Bengal tiger (*Panthera tigris tigris*) is one of the largest tiger subspecies. Males weigh between 220 to 660 pounds (100 to 300 kg) and can measure up to 10 feet (3 meters) in length, including the tail. Females are slightly smaller, weighing between 140 to 390 pounds (65 to 180 kg). Bengal tigers are known for their striking orange coats with black stripes, although some may exhibit white fur due to a rare genetic mutation, creating white tigers. With a muscular build, these tigers are incredibly powerful and agile, enabling them to take down prey much larger than themselves.</p>

        <h2>Habitat</h2>
        <p>Bengal tigers are native to India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Bhutan, thriving in tropical and subtropical rainforests, grasslands, and mangrove swamps like the Sundarbans. As solitary animals, they require large territories to roam and hunt, with each tiger maintaining its own territory.</p>

        <h2>Diet and Hunting</h2>
        <p>These carnivores primarily hunt large prey such as deer, wild boar, and water buffalo. Bengal tigers also hunt smaller animals and occasionally domestic livestock. Known for their ambush hunting style, they rely on stealth and their powerful physique to pounce on prey, delivering a fatal bite.</p>

        <h2>Behavior</h2>
        <p>Bengal tigers are mostly solitary, with each tiger maintaining its own territory. Males have larger territories that may overlap with those of multiple females. They communicate through scent markings, vocalizations, and body language. Unlike most cats, Bengal tigers enjoy water and are excellent swimmers.</p>

        <h2>Reproduction</h2>
        <p>Female Bengal tigers reach sexual maturity at around 3 to 4 years, while males mature slightly later. After a gestation period of approximately 3.5 months, a female usually gives birth to 2 to 4 cubs. Cubs stay with their mother for around 2 years before venturing off on their own.</p>

        <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
        <p>The Bengal tiger is currently listed as <strong>Endangered</strong> by the IUCN. Major threats to their survival include habitat loss, poaching, and conflicts with humans. Conservation efforts like India's Project Tiger and protected reserves are helping to preserve their population.</p>

        <h2>Population</h2>
        <p>There are an estimated 2,500 Bengal tigers in the wild, with the majority in India. Conservation efforts have contributed to a slight population increase, though they remain at risk due to illegal poaching and habitat fragmentation. As apex predators, Bengal tigers play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of their ecosystem by regulating herbivore populations.</p>
